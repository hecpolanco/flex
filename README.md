This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Description: 
Flex is a health and wellness focused application that provides a community for individuals to share personal achievements, progress or ideas through either the nutritional or activity feed. It was intended to uplift each user in being proud of what theyre currently doing in the nutritional or physical relm and further encourage growth of a positive wellbeing.
